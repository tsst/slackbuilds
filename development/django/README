Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid
development and clean, pragmatic design.  It includes a template
engine, and an object-relational mapper.

Although Django can be used without database functionality, it is
especially useful with database support.  Various databases are
supported through Python database bindings.  Due to the dynamic
nature of Python software, database bindings  are not required
when Django is built and can be installed later.
